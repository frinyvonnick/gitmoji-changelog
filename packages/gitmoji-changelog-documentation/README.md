## üöÄ Usage

Make sure you have [npx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx) installed (`npx` is shipped by default since npm `5.2.0`)

Run the following command at the root of your project and answer questions. `gitmoji-changelog` uses a [preset system](/PRESETS.md) to handle different type of project. The preset used by default is the Node.js one that look for project's information in the `package.json` file.

with npx:
```sh
npx gitmoji-changelog
```

with npm:
```sh
npm install -g gitmoji-changelog

cd my-project
gitmoji-changelog
```

It exists a generic preset that works for every kind of project. It looks for information in a `.gitmoji-changelogrc` file at the root of your project. This file must contain three mandatory properties: `name`, `description` and `version`.

.gitmoji-changelogrc:
```json
{
  "project": {
    "name": "gitmoji-changelog",
    "description": "A changelog generator for gitmoji üòú",
    "version": "2.0.1"
  }
}
```

You can change the preset used by `gitmoji-changelog` with the preset option.

```sh
npx gitmoji-changelog --preset generic
```


### Available commands

```sh
gitmoji-changelog [release]
gitmoji-changelog init
gitmoji-changelog update [release]
```

The first command listed above is the idiomatic usage of `gitmoji-changelog` (read the `How it works` for more information).

`release` argument is by default valued to `from-package`. It will retrieve the version from the selected `preset` (read `Presets` for more information). You can overwrite it with the tag you want to generate in the changelog.

### Options

| option                  | description                             | default value                      |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------------|

| --format                | changelog format (markdown, json)       | markdown                           |
| --preset                | define preset mode                      | node                               |
| --output                | output file path                        | ./CHANGELOG.md or ./CHANGELOG.json |
| --group-similar-commits | [‚öóÔ∏è,- beta] try to group similar commits | false                              |
| --author                | add the author in changelog lines       | false                              |
| --interactive -i        | select commits manually                 | false                              |
| --help                  | display help                            |                                    |

### Example

**Here an example output:** [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/frinyvonnick/gitmoji-changelog/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)

## üìö How it works

### Behavior

`CHANGELOG.md` doesn't exist:

The CLI will generate all previous changelog based on semver tags of your repo.

`CHANGELOG.md` exists:

_All previous semvers tags remain unchanged_. The CLI will add each tag since the last semver tag found in the `CHANGELOG.md` file.

**By default when you generate your changelog with `gitmoji-changelog`, the following mapping is used to group commits: [groupMapping.js](packages/gitmoji-changelog-core/src/groupMapping.js)**

### Workflow

Here the recommended workflow to generate your changelog file using `gitmoji-changelog`:

**Important:** Before generating, be sure to have all tags locally (e.g. `git fetch origin`)

1. Make changes and commit: `git commit -m ":sparkles: my awesome feature"`
2. Bump version (ex: `1.0.0`) in `package.json` using [semver](https://semver.org/) convention
3. Run `gitmoji-changelog`, then the file `CHANGELOG.md` is created or updated with all changes
4. You can freely edit the new release in the changelog file, it will not be overwritten with the next generation
5. Commit `package.json` and `CHANGELOG.md` file
6. Tag your release: `git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "v1.0.0"` (or create a Github release)
7. Push to the remote `git push --follow-tags`

_This workflow is related to the `node` preset but can be adapted to your own technology._

## ‚öôÔ∏è Presets

`gitmoji-changelog` use presets to get project metadata useful for its smooth operation. Here is the list of available presets:

- node (default preset)
- generic
- maven

Didn't see the preset you need in the list? Consider adding it. Presets are stored in a [presets](packages/gitmoji-changelog-cli/src/presets) folder in the `cli` package.

### Existing presets

#### Node

The node preset looks for a `package.json` file.

```json
{
  "name": "project-name",
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "description": "Some description",
}
```

#### Generic

The generic preset looks a `gitmoji-changelogrc` file.

```json
{
  "project": {
    "name": "yvonnickfrin.dev",
    "description": "My blog",
    "version": "1.1.0"
  }
}
```

It must contain all mandatory properties in a `project` property. The `gitmoji-changelogrc` file can contain other configuration properties like a custom commit categorization.

#### Maven

The maven preset looks for 4 properties in you `pom.xml`:

- groupid
- artifactid
- version
- description

### Add a preset

A preset need to export a function. When called this function must return three mandatory information about the project in which the cli has been called. The name of the project, a short description of it and its current version.

Let's dissect the `node` preset to see how it works. First of all the module must export a function. In case something went wrong return `null`. The cli will tell the user a problem occurred.

```js
module.exports = () => {
  return null
}
```

There is a package called `read-pkg-up` to get the first `package.json` in the parent folder structure. It returns its content as a JavaScript object. If we can't find a `package.json` or it is empty we return `null`.

```js
const readPkgUp = require('read-pkg-up')

module.exports = async () => {
  try {
    const packageInfo = await readPkgUp()

    if (!packageInfo.pkg) {
      throw Error('Empty package.json')
    }
  } catch (e) {
    return null
  }
}
```

If everything went fine we return the three mandatory information (name, description, version).

```js
const readPkgUp = require('read-pkg-up')

module.exports = async () => {
  try {
    const packageInfo = await readPkgUp()

    if (!packageInfo.pkg) {
      throw Error('Empty package.json')
    }

    return {
      name: packageInfo.pkg.name,
      description: packageInfo.pkg.description,
      version: packageInfo.pkg.version,
    }
  } catch (e) {
    return null
  }
}
```

That's it. Feel free to open an issue to ask for a new preset or open a pull request to add one.

All preset needs at least 3 pieces of informations to work:

- A project name
- A current version
- A description

They have their own way to get these.


## üê≥ Using Docker image

Launch `gitmoji-changelog` using the [official Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/yvonnick/gitmoji-changelog):
```sh
docker container run -it -v $(pwd):/app --rm yvonnick/gitmoji-changelog:latest
```

> `/app` is the directory where gitmoji-changelog expect your project in the container.

You can also build the image locally and use it directly:
```sh
# build the image:
docker image build -t yvonnick/gitmoji-changelog:dev .
# use it:
docker container run -it -v $(pwd):/app --rm yvonnick/gitmoji-changelog:dev
```
